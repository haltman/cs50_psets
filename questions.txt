1.  stdint.h is a header file that contains types of integers with specified widths, such as int32_t which represents a signed integer with a width of 32 bits.
2.  The point of using these is to specify integers of varying types and widths to then be aliased and used to create custom data types that are easier to use/communicate throughout the program.
3.  BYTE = 1 byte, DWORD = 4 bytes, LONG = 4 bytes, WORD = 2 bytes
4.  BM
5.  bfSize is the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file. Whereas biSize, is the number of bytes required by the structure itself.
6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB (device independent bitmap) and its origin is the upper-left corner.
7.  biBitCount
8.  fopen() might return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c if the file that the file pointer is pointing too doesn't exist.
9.  The third argument to fread is always 1 in our code, because there is only one unit of each size of information to be stored in the buffer: size 'BITMAPFILEHEADER' (14 bytes) and 'BITMAPINFOHEADER' (40 bytes).
10. 3
11. fseek() allows you to change/move the location/indicator of the file pointer back or forward.
12. SEEK_CUR is of type integer that contains the current location of the filer pointer.
